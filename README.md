##Overview of the project

PROJECT : CONVERT THE INPUT TAKEN IN THE FORM OF CELCIUS , FAHRENHEIT AND KELVIN AND GIVE HE OUTPUT IN ANOTHER SCALE

**OBJECTIVE**

The primary objective of this C program is to create a user-friendly application that:

    Converts temperatures between three different scales: Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.
    Allows users to input a temperature in one scale and receive the equivalent temperature in the other two scales.
    Handles user input robustly and provides clear output.

**Key Activities**

    Function Definition:
        The convertTemperature function is defined to handle the conversion logic based on the provided temperature and scale.

    Temperature Conversion Logic:
        The function contains a switch statement that determines which conversion to perform based on the input scale:
            Celsius to Fahrenheit and Kelvin.
            Fahrenheit to Celsius and Kelvin.
            Kelvin to Celsius and Fahrenheit.

    User Input Handling:
        The main function prompts the user to enter a temperature and the scale they wish to convert from.
        It reads the temperature as a floating-point number and the scale as a character.

    Output Display:
        After performing the conversions, the program displays the results with two decimal places for clarity.

    Error Handling:
        The program includes basic error handling by checking for invalid scale inputs and providing appropriate feedback.

  **Technologies Used**

    Programming Language: C
        The code is written in C, a widely-used programming language known for its efficiency and low-level access to memory.

    Standard Input/Output Library: stdio.h
        This library is included to facilitate standard input and output operations, such as reading user input and printing results to the console.

    Data Types:
        The program uses float for temperature values to allow for decimal precision in conversions.

    Control Flow:
        The program employs a switch statement to manage the different conversion cases, along with if statements for error handling.
